          <p><span class="assign-text-lead">CONTEXT</span> At Weekend 0 you learned reflected on your story of self - who you are and what you value as a person. In this week’s lesson we are going to take that exploration a step further. This week you will think about the intersection between your passions, your strengths, and how you can earn a living doing what you enjoy. In other words, how to you think about future careers that might be right for your skills and passions. Some of you may already have strong ideas about what careers you’d like to try. Others of you may have no idea. This lesson will help everyone reflect on their own strengths and explore strategies to confirm their career decisions or learn about possible opportunities. After all, it’s not uncommon for students to enter college with one career goal and leave with another. We’d like to help you navigate that process.</p>
          <p>This feels urgent, because the sooner you think about the work world  (freshmen year orientation is not too early!) and take specific steps to explore what you’d like to try and do more times, the better off you will be when you actually need to land a job after college as a graduating senior.  A recent study released by the Pew Research Institute in January asked recent college graduates what their biggest regrets were, and half of them said that getting more work experience while still in school could have better prepared them for the job they wanted to land.  This week will help you think about career fields, how much they pay and how to think about exploring these fields by requesting informational interviews.</p>
