          In securing an internship or job for the summer, consider your résumé as the crown jewel of your career portfolio. Just like companies have logos and “brand reputations” where they are publicly known for certain things, a résumé reflects your own personal brand and represents what you stand for as a leader and as a professional. It’s one of the most important professional documents that represents you; a good résumé will help you to open doors to interviews for competitive internships and job opportunities. Your objective in crafting a résumé is to set yourself apart from hundreds or thousands of other candidates and position yourself as uniquely suited for the opportunity for which you are applying. </p>        </div>

          During the BZ launch, you practiced crafting and delivering your leadership story. Leadership begins with understanding yourself: your values, your motivation, your story.  But leadership is also about enabling others to achieve purpose and enabling others to join with you in your development. Therefore, it’s important that you be able to share your story, which brings together your strengths/assets and your unique background. At Weekend 0, you got practice sharing your story as a personal narrative. Now, you will get practice telling your story in a professional context by way of a résumé and cover letter. Telling your story is important to your development as a leader and as professional.
