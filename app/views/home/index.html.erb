    <p><span class="large-quotes">&ldquo;</span>Beyond Z introduced me into the real world and how things work outside of academics! My interviewing skills have definitely grown and developed through my time at BZ. The networking I have done has exceeded any other time of my life, I have met some incredible people and stayed in touch with many of them. My decision to enter the Education field has been reinforced through my time at BZ as well, and all the connections I have made have impacted the way in which I think of approaching certain matters!<span class="large-quotes">&rdquo;</span>

      I loved getting to know the kids and hanging out with them - we got to know each of their personalities really well. I particularly loved watching them plan the Hackathon and seeing their efforts pay off. Their excitement for coding, planning, and leading at Beyond Hacks was contagious and I was thrilled for them.

I am excited to be an inaugural partner with Beyond Z because they will give students in our district the experiences, networks, and relationships that will empower them to become leaders in our communities, our nation, and the world. The Beyond Z curriculum and programming can help to level the playing field for under-represented populations lacking resources and human capital necessary to reach the highest levels of leadership.<span class="large-quotes">&rdquo;</span>
